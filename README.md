Arduino-Based-Kitchen-Hazard-Monitoring-System
An embedded system designed to enhance kitchen safety by detecting gas leaks, fire, and monitoring temperature and humidity. Built using Arduino Nano, this project integrates an MQ2 gas sensor, flame sensor, DHT11, buzzer, relay, and I2C LCD for real-time alerts and appliance control.

🧠 Features

🔥 Flame detection using IR flame sensor

🧪 Gas leak detection via MQ2 gas sensor

🌡️ Temperature & humidity monitoring using DHT11

🔔 Buzzer alert system for emergencies

⚡ Automatic relay cutoff to control appliances (e.g., gas valve or exhaust)

🖥️ I2C LCD display for real-time status

💡 Expandable for IoT integration (Wi-Fi or GSM)
